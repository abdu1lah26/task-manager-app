---

## 🎯 Key Features to Mention (In Interviews)

### 1. **Secure Authentication System** 🔐

**What to say:**

> "I implemented JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing. When users register, passwords are hashed with a salt before storing. On login, I verify credentials and return a JWT token that's stored in localStorage. Every protected API request includes this token in the Authorization header."

**Technical Details:**

- Passwords hashed using bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Middleware validates tokens on protected routes
- Automatic logout on token expiration

### 2. **Real-Time Collaboration** ⚡

**What to say:**

> "I used Socket.io to enable real-time updates. When one user creates or updates a task, all team members see the changes instantly without refreshing. The server broadcasts events to all connected clients in the same project room."

**Technical Details:**

- WebSocket connection established on user login
- Users join project-specific rooms
- Events: task-created, task-updated, task-deleted, comment-added
- User online/offline status tracking

### 3. **Complex Database Relationships** 🗄️

**What to say:**

> "I designed a normalized PostgreSQL schema with 5 related tables using foreign keys. It handles many-to-many relationships between users and projects through a junction table, plus one-to-many relationships for tasks and comments."

**Technical Details:**

- 5 tables: users, projects, project_members, tasks, comments
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Cascade deletes for related records
- Indexes on frequently queried columns

### 4. **RESTful API Design** 📡

**What to say:**

> "I built a REST API with proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), meaningful status codes (200, 201, 401, 403, 404, 500), and consistent JSON responses. All routes follow REST conventions."

**Technical Details:**

- 20+ endpoints across auth, projects, and tasks
- Middleware for authentication and error handling
- Input validation before database operations
- Proper error messages for debugging

### 5. **Role-Based Access Control** 👥

**What to say:**

> "I implemented role-based permissions where project owners can delete projects, admins can add/remove members, and regular members can only view and create tasks. This is validated both on the backend and frontend."

**Technical Details:**

- Roles: owner, admin, member
- Backend validation in controllers
- Frontend conditional rendering
- Protected routes and actions

├── id (Primary Key)
├── username (Unique)
├── email (Unique)
├── password (Hashed with bcrypt)
├── full_name
└── created_at

PROJECTS (Team projects)
├── id (Primary Key)
├── name
├── description
├── owner_id → USERS(id) [Foreign Key]
└── created_at

PROJECT_MEMBERS (Who's in which project)
├── id (Primary Key)
├── project_id → PROJECTS(id) [Foreign Key]
├── user_id → USERS(id) [Foreign Key]
├── role (owner/admin/member)
└── joined_at

TASKS (Individual tasks)
├── id (Primary Key)
├── title
├── description
├── project_id → PROJECTS(id) [Foreign Key]
├── assigned_to → USERS(id) [Foreign Key]
├── created_by → USERS(id) [Foreign Key]
├── status (todo/in_progress/completed)
├── priority (low/medium/high)
├── due_date
└── created_at

COMMENTS (Task discussions)
├── id (Primary Key)
├── task_id → TASKS(id) [Foreign Key]
├── user_id → USERS(id) [Foreign Key]
├── content
└── created_at
```

### Relationships Explained:

1. **One-to-Many**: One user owns many projects
2. **Many-to-Many**: Users can be members of many projects (via PROJECT_MEMBERS table)
3. **One-to-Many**: One project has many tasks
4. **One-to-Many**: One task has many comments
5. **One-to-Many**: One user creates many tasks
6. **One-to-Many**: One user is assigned to many tasks

**Interview Question: "Why use a separate PROJECT_MEMBERS table?"**  
**Answer:** "To handle the many-to-many relationship between users and projects, and to store additional data like role and joined_at for each membership."

## 🔐 How Authentication Works (Step-by-Step)

### Registration Flow:

```
1. User fills registration form (username, email, password)
2. Frontend sends POST /api/auth/register
3. Backend checks if email/username already exists
4. Password is hashed using bcrypt (10 rounds)
5. User data saved to database
6. JWT token generated with user info
7. Token sent back to frontend
8. Frontend stores token in localStorage
9. User is redirected to dashboard
```

### Login Flow:

```
1. User enters email and password
2. Frontend sends POST /api/auth/login
3. Backend finds user by email
4. Bcrypt compares password with stored hash
5. If valid, generate JWT token
6. Return token + user data
7. Frontend stores token in localStorage
8. User redirected to dashboard
```

### Protected Route Access:

```
1. User tries to access /api/projects
2. Frontend includes token in Authorization header
3. Backend middleware extracts token
4. JWT.verify() checks if token is valid
5. If valid, decode user info and continue
6. If invalid, return 401 Unauthorized
7. Frontend redirects to login
```

### JWT Token Contains:

```javascript
{
  userId: 1,
  email: "user@example.com",
  role: "member",
  exp: 1729876543 // Expiration timestamp
}
```

**Interview Tip:** Explain that JWT is "stateless" - server doesn't store sessions, just verifies the token signature.

---

## ⚡ Real-Time Features (Socket.io)

### How It Works:

**Connection Setup:**

```
1. User logs in
2. Frontend establishes WebSocket connection to server
3. Server assigns unique socket ID
4. User emits 'user-connected' with their user ID
5. Server maps userId → socketId
6. Other users see this user as "online"
```

**Project Room System:**

```
1. User opens a project page
2. Frontend emits 'join-project' with projectId
3. Server adds socket to that project's room
4. All events now broadcast only to this room
5. When user leaves page, emits 'leave-project'
```

**Real-Time Task Updates:**

```
1. User A creates a task
2. Frontend saves task via REST API
3. On success, emit 'task-created' event with task data
4. Server broadcasts to all users in project room
5. User B's frontend receives 'task-created' event
6. User B's UI updates automatically
```

### Socket Events We Use:

- `user-connected` - User comes online
- `user-status-changed` - Online/offline status
- `join-project` - Enter project room
- `leave-project` - Exit project room
- `task-created` - New task added
- `task-updated` - Task modified
- `task-deleted` - Task removed
- `task-status-changed` - Task moved on board
- `comment-added` - New comment
- `comment-deleted` - Comment removed

**Interview Question: "Why use Socket.io instead of polling?"**  
**Answer:** "Socket.io maintains a persistent connection, so updates are instant. Polling would repeatedly hit the server every few seconds, wasting bandwidth and creating delay. Socket.io is more efficient and provides true real-time experience."

## ✨ Code Quality & Best Practices

### What Makes This Code Professional:

#### 1. **JSDoc Documentation** 📝

We added JSDoc comments to all key functions:

```javascript
/**
 * Authentication middleware - Validates JWT token from request header
 * @param {Object} req - Express request object
 * @param {Object} res - Express response object
 * @param {Function} next - Express next middleware function
 */
export const authenticate = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Implementation...
};
```

#### 2. **Clean Code Principles** ✅

- **No unnecessary comments** - Code is self-explanatory
- **Meaningful variable names** - `authenticateUser` not `func1`
- **Single Responsibility** - Each function does one thing
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Reusable middleware
- **Consistent formatting** - Same style throughout

#### 3. **Security Best Practices** 🔒

- Passwords NEVER stored in plain text (bcrypt hashing)
- Environment variables for secrets
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- Token expiration (7 days)

#### 4. **Project Organization** 📁

## 💬 Interview Talking Points

### Common Questions & Your Answers:

**Q: "Walk me through your project."**  
**A:** "I built a full-stack task management application using React and Node.js. Users can register securely with JWT authentication, create projects, invite team members, and manage tasks with a drag-and-drop board. The standout feature is real-time collaboration using Socket.io - when one team member updates a task, everyone sees it instantly. I used PostgreSQL with a normalized schema to handle complex relationships between users, projects, and tasks."

**Q: "What was the most challenging part?"**  
**A:** "Implementing real-time updates with Socket.io while maintaining data consistency. I had to design a room-based system where users join project-specific rooms, and carefully coordinate REST API calls with WebSocket events. For example, when creating a task, the API saves it to the database first, then broadcasts to all room members only on success. This prevents race conditions."

**Q: "How did you handle authentication?"**  
**A:** "I implemented JWT-based stateless authentication. During registration, passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage. On login, I verify credentials and return a JWT token containing the user's ID and role. This token is included in the Authorization header for all protected routes. I created a middleware that validates tokens and attaches user info to the request object."

**Q: "Explain your database design."**  
**A:** "I designed a normalized PostgreSQL schema with 5 tables and foreign key relationships. Users can own multiple projects and be members of others, which required a junction table (project_members) for the many-to-many relationship. Tasks belong to projects and can be assigned to users, with comments linked to both tasks and users. I used CASCADE deletes so removing a project automatically cleans up its members and tasks."

**Q: "How would you scale this application?"**  
**A:** "For scaling, I'd: 1) Add Redis for caching and sessions, 2) Implement database read replicas, 3) Use a message queue for async operations, 4) Deploy Socket.io with sticky sessions and Redis adapter for multi-server deployments, 5) Add CDN for static assets, 6) Implement pagination for large lists, and 7) Add database indexes on frequently queried fields."
